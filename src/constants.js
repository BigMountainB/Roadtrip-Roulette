// letter of the town, with single-letter conflicts resolved by the next
// distinguishing character (e.g. Othello = 'O', Royal City = 'Y' to dodge
// future conflicts).
// Rest stops with per-stop amenity sets.  Mileage is the on-road exit
// point, hand-tweaked away from bridges (Lacey V Murrow at mile 7-8 +
// East Channel at 10-11.5) so the off-ramp lands on dry land.  `exit`
// is now the displayed sign label (real-world WA highway exit numbers).

//   gas | hunting | camp | dealer | vices
// The rest-stop scene's landing screen filters tiles to this list, so
// a camp-only stop only shows the Camp tile.
//
